# piThing 
## Project By: Joseph Hale 
This project is a means of making an alternative Spotify car thing with a raspberry pi and a touch screen. 
This project utilizes 3D prints, and a python script that interfaces with the Spotify API to control playback and get track information. 

## Why piThing? 
I wanted a project to allow to me to work more with the hands on electronics of a raspberry pi as well as write some fun API code. I also was able to use parts I had lying around to create this device. 

## Tutorial. 
First up, software.  
### Spotify side 
The first thing you'll need is a Spotify developer account. Follow this [link](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/login) and sign into/create a Spotify account to create one. You'll want to use the Spotify account you want to control with the piThing for this step. 

Then you'll want to create a app from the dashboard and name it as you'd like.  

Take note of the client_ID and client_secret, you'll need them later for authentication to your app. 

Next well set a redirection URI. Click EDIT SETTINGS and type an address you'd like to use here and click add. I went with https://www.google.com/callback 

### Raspberry pi 

Next well set up the raspberry pi. For times sake I wont go over installing Raspberry PI OS, but [here](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/getting-started.html) is a good tutorial from raspberry Pi themselves.
