# piThing
## Project By: Joseph Hale
This project is a means of making an alternative spotify car thing with a raspberry pi and a touch screen.
This project utalises 3D prints, and a python script that interfaces with the Spotify API to control playback and get track information.

## Why piThing?
I wanted a project to allow to me to work more with the hands on electronics of a raspberry pi as well as write some fun API code. I also was able to use parts I had lying around to create this device.

## Tutorial.
First up, software. 
The first thing you'll need is a spotify developer account. Follow this [link](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/login) and create one.

Then you'll want to create a app from the dashboard and name it as you'd like.
